### Question {#question}

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Only constant memory is allowed.

**Example:**

```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```

### Thought Process {#thought-process}

1. Iterative
   1. Reverse the node in the range
   2. If we don't have enough node, we stop
   3. Time complexity O\(n\)
   4. Space complexity O\(1\)
2. asd

### Solution

```java

```
