### Question {#question}

Follow up for "[033-Search in Rotated Sorted Array](/leetcode/array/033-search-in-rotated-sorted-array.md)":  
What ifduplicatesare allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

\(i.e.,`0 1 2 4 5 6 7`might become`4 5 6 7 0 1 2`\).

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example:**

```
