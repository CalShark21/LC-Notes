### Question {#question}

[https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/description/)

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.

If version1 &gt; version2 return 1, if version1 &lt; version2 return -1, otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

**Example:**

```
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 13.37
```

### Thought Process {#thought-process}

1. Split and Compare
   1. Start from the first field until we reach the end or the numbers are different
   2. Time complexity O\(n\), where n is number of fields
   3. Space complexity O\(n\)

### Solution

```java

```
