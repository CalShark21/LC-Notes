[https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/)

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some \(can be none\) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. \(ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not\).

**Example:**

```
Here is an example:
S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

Return 3.
