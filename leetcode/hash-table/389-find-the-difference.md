### Question {#question}

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/)

Given two strings **s **and **t **which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **t **is generated by random shuffling string **s **and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **t**.

**Example:**

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Thought Process {#thought-process}

1. Hash Table
   1. Use count array to store the frequency of character, increase for string s and decrease t
   2. Loop from letter a to z, the first encounter of count = 1 is our answer
   3. Time complexity O\(n\)
   4. Space complexity O\(n\) or O\(1\)
2. Sum
   1. Similar to above, we add the character from s and deduct the character from t
   2. The final sum is the character
   3. Time complexity O\(n\)
   4. Space complexity O\(1\)
3. XOR
   1. XOR all the character
   2. Time complexity O\(n\)
   3. Space complexity O\(1\)

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int n = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            count[s.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
            count[t.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        count[t.charAt(n) - 'a']++;
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count[i] == 1) {
                c = i + 'a';
                break;
            }
        }
        return (char) c;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            diff -= s.charAt(i);
            diff += t.charAt(i);
        }
        diff += t.charAt(s.length());
        return (char) diff;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int n = s.length();
        char c = t.charAt(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c ^= s.charAt(i);
            c ^= t.charAt(i);
        }
        return c;
    }
}
```
