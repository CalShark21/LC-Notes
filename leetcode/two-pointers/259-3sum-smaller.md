Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; n that satisfy the condition nums\[i\] + nums\[j\] + nums\[k\] &lt; target.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.
Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:

[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]
```
