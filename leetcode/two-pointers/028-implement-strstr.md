Implement [strStr\(\)](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1 **if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example:**

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

### Thought Process {#thought-process}

1. Two Pointers
   1. At each position, we simply compare the letter matches
   2. Time complexity O\(hn\), where h is the length of haystack and n is length of needle
   3. Space complexity O\(1\)

### Solution

```java

```
