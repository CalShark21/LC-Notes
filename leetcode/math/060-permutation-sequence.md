[https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/description/)

The set \[1,2,3,â€¦,n\] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

We get the following sequence \(ie, for n = 3\):

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

**Example:**
