Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integerm, you can split the array intomnon-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among thesemsubarrays.

**Note:**  
Ifnis the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ m ≤ min\(50, n\)

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
